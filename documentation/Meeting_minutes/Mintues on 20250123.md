# Meeting Agenda:
1. Discussion on the application scenarios and YAML file of the Verified Caller API

# Meeting Minutes:
1. All attendees agreed on the following:

+ The functional scope of the API is limited to displaying caller identity information in text form.
+ Multimedia and other implementation methods will invite operator input on Version 2 requirements and scenarios.
+ China Telecom’s release plan for Version 1 (API Definition is planned for completion by early March, Test Definitions is targeted for completion by early April, User Story is to be completed by the end of April).

2. Discussion on the Verified Call API scenarios and YAML file:
+ Further clarification is needed on the relationship between the API and application scenarios, as well as the correlation between input/output parameters and scenarios in the YAML file.
+ Since the technical implementation is not limited to SMS, the names of “SMSSendRequest” and “SMSSendResponse” need to be modified. Possible replacements include “BrandingSendRequest” or “SendTextRequest.”

# Next Steps and Timeline:
1. Margaret Pan will discuss with the internal team and provide the mapping of scenarios and YAML file content via email. Updates to the YAML file will be made if necessary.
2. Olsi will share Vodafone's Verified Call application scenarios.
